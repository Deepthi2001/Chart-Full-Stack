# Setting Up the Next.js Project

## 1. Create the Project Directory

1. **Navigate to your desired directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir nextjs-frontend
    cd nextjs-frontend
    ```

2. **Create a new Next.js application:**
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest .
    ```

3. **Install necessary dependencies:**
    - Install a charting library (e.g., `recharts`) and `axios` for API requests:
      ```bash
      npm install recharts axios
      ```

4. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. **How to run the repo**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

Your Next.js project is now set up and running. You can start building your frontend and integrating it with your backend.
